// 800 and 600 are the width and height of the canvas
// new Phaser.Game creates an instance of a Phaser Game object
// Phaser.AUTO is the rendering context. Auto automatically tries
// to use WebGL, but if the browser or deivce doesn't support it 
// it'll fall back to Canvas
/*The fourth parameter is an empty string, this is the id of the DOM element in which you would like to insert the canvas element that Phaser creates. As we've left it blank it will simply be appended to the body. The final parameter is an object containing four references to Phasers essential functions. Their use is thoroughly explained here. Note that this object isn't required - Phaser supports a full State system allowing you to break your code into much cleaner single objects. But for a simple Getting Started guide such as this we'll use this approach as it allows for faster prototyping.*/
